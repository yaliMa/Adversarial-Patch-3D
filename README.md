# Enhancing Real-World Adversarial Patches with 3D Modeling Techniques
This reposetory is a work in progress. I'm working on uploading all the resources of this paper (including instructions for building the real world evaluation setup). 
The paper is [available here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05334).
The instructions for modeling the scene's replica and building the real-world evaluation setup are  [available here](https://www.instructables.com/Evaluation-Setup-for-Real-World-Adversarial-Patche/).
